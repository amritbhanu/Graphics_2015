For this program to work, we will need a lamp server to be hosted on local machine as I have used Xmlhttprequest for reading the files.
I have included the obj files for which this code is tested with (vase and head)

Just run the index.html

I have used jquery to read the url string of  (myassignment/index.html?objfilepath=[objfilepath])
Here please only specify the objfilepath=vase or head. Don't include the folder name. Keep obj,mtl and texture files in the obj folder.
For jquery, you will need to have internet so that jquery.js can be accessed.

For the texture, it will first be rendered with blue pixels. Please press any keyboard input to display the included textures.
